[{"id":"1626582703386","title":"Top 10 Tech Jobs","content":"It’s hard to go wrong with a technology degree. According to the National Association of Colleges and Employers, computer science is the STEM major with the highest job offer and job acceptance rate. Perhaps that’s why a recent CareerBuilder survey revealed that from in the 2010s, the number of students completing science technology degrees grew by nearly 50%, and the number of computer and information science students rose by almost one-third, making these two degrees among the fastest growth rates in the U.S.1﻿\n\nA degree in a computer-related field can lead to a variety of well-paying and high-demand jobs. The best tech jobs pay significantly more than the average median wage of $34,750 and have projected growth rates that are faster than the 11% overall rate anticipated for the average U.S. job.\n\nBy sorting through data from several sources, including the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and jobs website GlassDoor, we compiled the following list of the ten best tech jobs.\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Data Scientist\n- Job outlook through 2020: not available\n- Number of new jobs through 2020: not available\n- Median annual wage: $118,709\n\nWhile specific job outlook and new job numbers are not available from the BLS, the Harvard Business Review (HBR) calls data scientists “the sexiest job of the 21st century.\" There is a high demand for individuals who can evaluate data to help companies make business decisions; however, there is a relatively low supply of qualified candidates.\n\nAccording to a Burtch Works report, salaries for level three data scientist managers are as high as $250,000. Burtch Works also notes that most data scientists have either a Master’s degree or a Ph.D. in mathematics/statistics, computer science, or engineering.\n\n\n2. Software Developer\n- Job outlook through 2020: 22%\n- Number of new jobs through 2020: 222,600\n- Median annual wage: $102,880\n\nBy far, the largest number of job openings on the list is for software developers. This growth is fueled by the demand for mobile apps and other products that are driven by technology. While some software developers design applications, systems software developers design operating systems and interfaces. A bachelor’s degree in computer science, software engineering, or mathematics is usually a requirement.\n\n\n3. Information Security Analyst \n- Job outlook through 2020: 37%\n- Number of new jobs through 2020: 27,400\n- Median annual wage: $88,890\n\nMore than one billion records were breached in 2014, according to Gemalto, an international security company. These breaches illustrate the urgent need for information security analysts. A bachelor’s degree in computer science or programming is the typical requirement, although some employers prefer an MBA in information systems.\n\n\n4. Computer Systems Analyst\n- Job outlook through 2020: 25%\n- Number of new jobs through 2020: 127,700\n- Median annual wage: $82,710\n\nComputer systems analysts are needed to design and install new computer systems, and IT consulting firms hire most of them. Growth has occurred primarily in the following areas: cloud computing, mobile technology, and healthcare records. Candidates usually need a bachelor’s degree in a computer-related field, although the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reports that sometimes a liberal arts degree is sufficient.\n\n\n5. Web Developer\n- Job outlook through 2020: 20%\n- Number of new jobs through 2020: 28,500\n- Median annual wage: $63,490\n\nThis is one of the few jobs on the list that you can get without a bachelor’s degree. There are three types of web developers; web designers, who create the layout and feel of the website, need an associate degree in web design.\n\nWebmasters, who maintain the website, may have a webmaster certificate, an associate degree in web development, or a bachelor’s degree, depending on the employer. Web architects, who handle the technical construction of the site, usually need a bachelor’s degree in programming or computer science.\n\n\n6. Sales Engineer \n- Job outlook through 2020: 35%\n- Number of new jobs through 2020: 5,900 total (specific numbers for technology not available)\n- Median annual wage: $96,340\n\nThe demand for sales engineers in other industries is only projected to increase by 9%; however, the growth rate is four times as fast for professionals selling computer software and hardware. Most sales engineers have a degree in business, science, or a technology field. They must also be well-versed in technology to present proposals, explain products, and answer questions.\n\n\n7.

As a client-side programming language, JavaScript helps web developers to make web pages dynamic and interactive by implementing custom client-side scripts. At the same time, the developers can also use cross-platform runtime engines like Node.js to write server-side code in JavaScript. They can even combine JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3 to create web pages that look good across browsers, platforms, and devices. There are also a number of reasons why each modern web developer must know how to leverage all benefits of JavaScript.\n\n\n\nWhy No Web Developer can Create Modern Web Applications without JavaScript?\nImplement Client-Side Scripts\n\nJavaScript was originally designed as a client-side scripting language. A large percentage of websites still use JavaScript as a client-side programming language. The web developers can easily write custom client-side scripts in JavaScript, and integrate the scripts seamlessly into HTML. They can further use JavaScript to make the web pages interactive, respond to users instaneously, and create richer user interfaces, without less server interaction and reduces server load.\n\n\n\nWrite Server-Side Code\n\nThe web developers can also write server-side code in JavaScript by using a cross-platform runtime engine like Node.js. Node.js is designed as a cross-platform and server-side runtime environment. It further executes the JavaScript code efficiently through Google V8 JavaScript engine. The built-in libraries provided by Node.js further allow programmers to run their web applications smoothly without relying on external web servers. Hence, the web developers can use Node.js to write both client-side and server-side code in JavaScript.\n\n\n\nSimplify Complex Web Application Development\n\nDespite being an interpreted programming language, JavaScript simplifies development of complex web applications by allowing developers to simplify the application’s composition. The programmers can use JavaScript libraries to create shadow DOM boundaries. In addition to simplifying the web application’s structure, the shadow DOM further decouples components of individual JavaScript libraries. The shadow DOM further make web browsers deliver documents with widely used HTML tags like div, select and input.\n\n\n\n\nReference:\n\nMedia Fire Solutions\nhttps://medium.com/@mindfiresolutions.usa/how-important-is-javascript-for-modern-web-developers-2854309b9f52","post_image":"uploads/post-image-1626582044379.png","added_date":"1626582044396"},{"id":"1626581509027","title":"The Story of Lorem Ipsum","content":"What is Lorem Ipsum?\n\nLorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.\n\n\n\nWhere does it come from?\n\nContrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\n\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.\n\n\n\nReference: lipsum.com","post_image":"uploads/post-image-1626581509009.png","added_date":"1626581509027"},{"id":"1581375207401","title":"Why learning coding is important?","content":"Nowadays with everything being electronic, everything needs to be programmed! \n\nFrom computers, to cars, machines, or anything else it most likely requires programming!\n\nSo as a result, demand for coders keeps increasing year by year, due to all these technological advances!","post_image":"uploads/post-image-1581375207393.jpg","added_date":"1581375207401"}]
